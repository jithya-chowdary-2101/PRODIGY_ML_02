## Introduction

Welcome to my second machine learning project! The primary objective of this project is to create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.This clustering can provide valuable insights for personalized marketing strategies, customer targeting, and overall business decision-making. It uses the customers' annual income and spending score to create clusters and visualizes the results.


## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

I began by thoroughly exploring the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics.This involved analyzing CustomerID,Gender,Age,Annual Income,Spending Score (1-100) from the given dataset.For a retail store, clustering customers based on their purchase history can help in understanding customer behavior, segmentation for targeted marketing, and improving customer experience.


## Results

**1.Optimal Clusters:** 5 clusters were determined as optimal for customer segmentation.
**2.Insights:** The analysis revealed distinct customer segments, aiding in targeted marketing efforts and personalized customer engagement.


## Conclusion

The code demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The visual representation allows for the identification of distinct customer segments. Further analysis or targeted marketing strategies can be devised based on the identified clusters. The code provides a straightforward example of using clustering techniques for customer segmentation.
